# Preparing your Node for Operation

If you're here, then you've succesfully started the Smartnode services, created a wallet, and finished syncing both the Execution (ETH1) and Consensus (ETH2) chains on your respective clients. 
If so, then you are ready to register your node on the Rocket Pool network and create a minipool with an ETH2 validator!
If not, please review the previous sections and return here once you've completed those steps.

Before creating a new minipool and ETH2 validator, there are a few steps to take to finish preparing your node.
These only need to be done once though; once you've done them, you can skip to the [Creating a New Minipool](./create-validator.md) section if you want to create multiple minipools on your node.


## Loading your Node Wallet

Registering your node and standing up a validator both involve submitting transactions to the Ethereum network from your node wallet.
This means **you'll need to have some ETH on it** to pay for the gas costs of those transactions.
You'll also need to stake some of the **RPL token** prior to creating a minipool as collateral; you can do this directly on the node, or (preferably) you can use the Rocket Pool website's **Stake on Behalf** function to stake for your node with RPL in your cold wallet.
We'll discuss the Stake on Behalf feature later in this guide when it's time to stake your RPL.

The ETH required for gas fees to set up a node with one minipool is about 0.0025 ETH times the current gas price in gwei.
For example, with a gas price of 30 gwei, you would pay about 0.075 ETH in gas fees.

See [this worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1loB9U8wCIJn73a1DsR-mJJ9PQaYWMlF9asNc7BgM_zc/edit#gid=1413609552https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1loB9U8wCIJn73a1DsR-mJJ9PQaYWMlF9asNc7BgM_zc/edit#gid=1413609552 ) to help estimate the gas fees for various network conditions.

::: tab Running on the Prater Test Network
If you're running on the Prater test network, please see the [Practicing with the Test Network](../testnet/overview.md) section to learn how to acquire test ETH.

For test RPL, we have added a similar faucet function directly to the CLI.
Please see the [Getting Test RPL on Goerli](../testnet/overview.md#getting-test-rpl-on-goerli) guide to acquire some.
:::
::: tab Running on the Main Network
We assume that you already have a separate Ethereum-compatible wallet that is holding your ETH.
If you need RPL, you can purchase it on a centralized exchange such as [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/prices/rocket-pool?quote=usd) or a decentralized exchange such as [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/trade/ether/0xD33526068D116cE69F19A9ee46F0bd304F21A51f).

Start by transferring some ETH from your existing wallet to the node wallet.
If running on Mainnet, **leave your RPL on the wallet you used to purchase it.**

As a reminder, you can use `rocketpool wallet status` to get the address of the node wallet if you need it.
If you are not sure how to send cryptocurrency from your existing wallet, please consult your wallet's documentation.

::: danger
Sending cryptocurrency across wallets is a non-reversible operation!
If you enter the wrong recipient address, **there is no way to retrieve your tokens**.
We recommend you send a small amount of ETH first as a **test transaction** to verify that you correctly entered the node wallet's address, and then **whitelist** that address in your other wallet, if possible, to avoid mistyping it.

## Registering your Node with the Network

Once you have ETH in your wallet, you can register your node with the Rocket Pool network to access all of its features.
To do this, run the following command:

```
rocketpool node register
```

This will prompt you for the timezone you want to register with.
By default, this will detect the timezone from your system clock, but you can change it if you prefer.
Any of the `Country/City` format timezones [listed on this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) should be acceptable.

::: tip NOTE
The timezone is just used for the global map of node operators displayed on the main site.
You don't need to set it to your actual timezone if you have security concerns.
If you prefer to remain anonymous, use a generic option such as `Etc/UTC`.
:::

Once this is complete, you will officially be a member of the Rocket Pool network!


## Setting your Withdrawal Address

Before anything else, we highly recommended you change the **withdrawal address** for your node.
This is the address that all of your RPL checkpoint rewards, your staked RPL, and your Beacon Chain ETH will be sent to when you claim your checkpoint rewards or exit your validator and withdraw from your minipool.

::: warning NOTE
By default, this is set to your node's wallet address.
However, for security reasons, **it's recommended to set this to a different cold wallet that you control, such as a MetaMask address or a hardware wallet.**

This way, if your node wallet is compromised, the attacker doesn't get access to your staked ETH and RPL by forcing you to exit because all of those funds will be sent to your separate cold wallet (which they hopefully do not have).

Withdrawal addresses are set at a node operator level. If you create multiple minipools they will all refer to the same withdrawal address. So you only need to perform this setup once.
:::

There are two different ways to do this.
Please read both options below to determine which one applies to you.

::::: tabs
:::: tab Method 1
**Use this method if your new withdrawal address can be used to sign transactions via MetaMask or WalletConnect.**

::: warning NOTE
This method will require you to **submit a transaction** from your new withdrawal address, so **you must have a small amount of ETH in that address already.**
:::

::: warning NOTE
For users of **Ledger** hardware wallets, note that Ledger Live does not yet support MetaMask or WalletConnect natively.
You will need to use MetaMask and connect it to your Ledger instead.
Follow [the official Ledger instructions](https://www.ledger.com/academy/security/the-safest-way-to-use-metamask) to do this.

To work with the Rocket Pool website, you will need to have your Ledger connected, unlocked, and the ETH app open.
You will also need to **enable "blind signing"** for the current session; you can find this within the Settings portion of the ETH app on the device.
Bind signing will automatically be disabled after you close the session.

If you are using Prater Testnet and want to use your Ledger as your withdrawal address, **you must create a new Ethereum wallet on your Ledger** first to ensure you don't connect your live address to the test network, which tends to cause confusion.
Make sure to select the **Goerli Testnet** in the network selection dropdown when connecting your Ledger to MetaMask.
Note that Ledger Live will not show your balance on the test network, but other applications which support the test network (such as MetaMask and Etherscan) will be able to display it.
:::

1. Run `rocketpool node set-withdrawal-address <your cold wallet address>`. Your new withdrawal address will be marked as "pending". Until you confirm it, **your old withdrawal address will still be used**.
2. To confirm it, you must send a special transaction **from your new withdrawal address** to the minipool contract to verify that you own the withdrawal address.
   1. The easiest way to do this is to navigate to the Rocket Pool withdrawal address site (for the [Prater Testnet](https://testnet.rocketpool.net/withdrawal/) or for [Mainnet](https://stake.rocketpool.net/withdrawal/)).
   2. If you haven't already connected Metamask or WalletConnect to the Rocket Pool website, do this now. Click the **select wallet** button in the center of the screen, and choose MetaMask or WalletConnect based on which wallet you would like to use. You will then be prompted asking you to confirm the connection. For example, using MetaMask:
   <center>
   ![](./images/connect-metamask.png)
   </center>
   Click **Next**, then click **Confirm** to enable the Rocket Pool website to use your wallet.
   3. Select **Withdrawal Address** from the top menu (or the hamburger menu on the left side if you're on a mobile device).
   4. You will see this prompt:
   <center>
   ![](./images/node-address.png)
   </center>
   Type your **node wallet address** here and click on the **Check Mark button** to continue.
   5. You will be prompted with a question asking if you want to set a new node withdrawal address or confirm a pending one. Select **Confirm**.
   6. Now, there should be a new confirmation dialog in your wallet. Again, using MetaMask as an example, click the MetaMask icon to open it and you should see something like this:
   <center>
   ![](./images/confirm-address.png)
   </center>
   Click **Confirm** to send the transaction to the network. This will take some time until it gets mined, but once it does, you will see a confirmation dialog:
   <center>
   ![](./images/confirmed.png)
   </center>
3. Your new withdrawal address will now be confirmed and activated. You can view this with `rocketpool node status`.
::::

:::: tab Method 2

**Use this method only if your withdrawal address *cannot* be used to sign transactions via MetaMask or WalletConnect.**

In this method, you will run:

```
rocketpool node set-withdrawal-address --force <your cold wallet address>
```

You will be offered the chance to send a test transaction before confirming this, to ensure that you have the right address.
If you confirm this command when it prompts you, your new withdrawal address will be set immediately.

::: danger
By doing this, you bypass the safety measure associated with Method 1, which requires you to prove that you own the new address.
If you make a typo here, there is no way to undo it and **your minipool's rewards will be lost forever**.

We **strongly** encourage you to use the test transaction mechanism before confirming this, and if possible, use Method 1 instead.
:::
::::
:::::

Once this is done, you will **no longer be able to change your withdrawal address using the `set-withdrawal-address` command**.
To change it, you will need to send a signed transaction from your **active** withdrawal address (the one you just switched to).
The Rocket Pool website has a function to help you do this.


## Setting your Voting Delegate Address

Rocket Pool's governance process uses [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/about) as the platform for hosting governance proposals.
Voting on them is done in-browser, via a wallet like MetaMask or a bridge like WalletConnect.
Node operators can vote on these proposals using the RPL they have staked (their **effective stake**).

Since your node's wallet should **never leave your node** (e.g. you should **never import your mnemonic into MetaMask or another wallet**), we have set up a system that allows you to **delegate** your node's voting power to a separate address.
This could be another wallet (such as a MetaMask account) that you control, or you could delegate your voting power to [one of the Node Operators that have elected to be official delegates](https://delegates.rocketpool.net/).

::: tip NOTE
If you are an **Allnodes user**, you can use your node account as the voting address and can ignore the following guides.
They are intended for normal Smartnode operators.
:::

Setting up a voting delegate address that can vote on behalf of your node is a one-time action.
Simply run the following command:

```
$ rocketpool node set-voting-delegate <address>
```

The address you use depends on whether you are voting yourself or you are delegating your vote to an official delegate.
If you are voting yourself, use the address of the wallet you want to use in-browser (e.g. your MetaMask account, your hardware wallet, your Argent wallet, etc.).

:::: danger WARNING
As a reminder, **DO NOT enter your node's wallet or mnemonic into MetaMask or any other wallet!**
The voting delegate feature is specifically designed to ensure you have no need to do this, which helps maintain the security of your node!
::::

At anytime, you can reassign your voting power by setting the voting address from your node.

One limitation of Snapshot is that **you must have delegated before the proposal you would like to vote on is created**.
We suggest that you set up your voting address or delegate early so that you don’t miss any proposal votes.

## Next Steps

The next steps to prepare your node will teach you about setting up a fallback node, how priority fees work, your Fee Distributor and the Smoothing Pool, and MEV.
Each topic will require you to make a choice about how you want to run your node.
Please move on to the next sections in the guide when you're ready.

Once you're done with those topics, you'll be guided through the process of making a minipool and earning staking rewards.
