# :book: [WIP] Staking Overview

In general, staking is the act of depositing ETH to activate validator software.
This software is responsible for storing data, processing transactions, and adding new blocks to the blockchain.
This will keep Ethereum secure for everyone and earn new ETH in the process.
This process, known as proof-of-stake, is being introduced by the [Beacon Chain](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/beacon-chain/). 

**For Rocket Pool staking users**, staking means swapping as little as 0.01 ETH for rETH.  
When a user deposits ETH into the Rocket Pool network, they will instantly receive the rETH token which represents a tokenised staking deposit and the rewards it gains over time in the Rocket Pool network.  
All of these ETH deposits are added to a pool that is drawn upon by Rocket Pool node operators.

**For Rocket Pool node operators**, staking means running the Rocket Pool node software (on their own hardware or in the cloud) that operates as an active validator.  
The node operator deposits 16 ETH that is paired via smart contract with 16 ETH from the aforementioned pool of ETH from the Rocket Pool staking users.  
The node operator must also deposit RPL worth at least 1.6 ETH, which acts as insurance for the staking users against the node operator acting maliciously.

## Tax Implications

Each country has their own tax laws, and it would be impossible to document them all here.  
In some countries, swapping ETH for rETH may be considered a taxable event.  
Tax laws related to crypotcurrencies are in their infancy -- each user should do their own research and consider speaking with a tax professional.  
Here are a couple of sites that claim to assist users with taxes related to Ethereum (this is not an endorsement and users should proceed at their own risk):
