# :ledger: Guides Overview

Welcome to the Guides section of the Rocket Pool documentation!
Here you will find various guides that walk you through every step of the various Rocket Pool processes.

If you're looking to stake your ETH with Rocket Pool and receive rETH in return, please visit the [Staking Guide](./staking/overview.md).
Staking is a very simple process, and this guide is filled with step-by-step instructions (including screenshots) that show you how it's done.

If you're interested in running a Rocket Pool node to create your own ETH2 validators, take a look at our [Node Operator's guide](./node/responsibilities.md).
This is a very comprehensive guide that goes over all of the considerations involved in node operation, including:

- Deciding to run a node locally at home, or remotely on the cloud
- Selecting the hardware for a local machine, or selecting a remote hosting provider
- Preparing and securing the operating system of your node
- Selecting your ETH1 and ETH2 clients
- Installing Rocket Pool's Smartnode stack
- Creating a new ETH2 validator using the Rocket Pool network
- Maintaining and updating your node

Both guides will show you how to practice for free on the Rocket Pool testnet so you can get a feel for everything without risking any of your real-life ETH.

::: warning NOTE
The guides are also written to support the processes on the Ethereum mainnet when you're ready to stake your real funds, but Rocket Pool is currently still in beta and does not operate on mainnet yet.

When you're ready, select a guide from the options above based on your interests.
