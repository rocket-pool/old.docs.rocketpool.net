# Rocket Pool Subgraph Introduction

Rocket Pool has a GraphQL API Endpoint hosted by [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/about/introduction#what-the-graph-is) called a subgraph for indexing and organizing data from the Rocket Pool smart contracts.

This subgraph is can be used to query Rocket Pool data.

Subgraph information is serviced by a decentralized group of server operators called Indexers - and thus our decentralized staking service also has decentralized data endpoints.

The subgraph was built and maintained by Rocket Pool community members.
