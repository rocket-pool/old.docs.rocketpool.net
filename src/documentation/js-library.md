# :card_index_dividers: Javascript Library

## Introduction

The Rocket Pool JavaScript library is the primary means of interaction with the Rocket Pool network for users and applications. It is used by applications such as the Rocket Pool website to retrieve information about the network and facilitate user interaction. It provides wrapper methods which load the Rocket Pool contracts with web3.js and abstractions to use many of their features easily.

This guide assumes familiarity with JavaScript and provides all code samples as JS.
