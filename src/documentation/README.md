Rocket Pool is a first of its kind ETH2 Proof of Stake Protocol, designed to be community owned, decentralised, trustless and compatible with staking in Ethereum 2.0.

If you wish to secure your node, understand the smart node CLI better, figure out how to build on top of our smart contracts or even use our javascript library to build your own frontend for the protocol as a whitelabel staking solution, then you're at the right place.

If you're after guides on how to install our smart node stack on your home server or a variety of other providers and operating systems, please checkout the [guides section](/guides) :point_left:
